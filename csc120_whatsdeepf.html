        <strong>What’s deepfake technology?<br></strong>
	The deepfake technology is a term referred to a type of AI’s which are capable of generating fake audios, images, or videos. This content generated from AI tends to be highly realistic and sometimes difficult to differentiate if it’s a
     real image or a fake one. The term “deepfake”, comes from the words “deep learning” and “fake”.<br>

	Usually deepfake technologies use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).<br><br>

<br><strong>PROS AND CONS OF DEEPFAKE TECHNOLOGY<br></strong>

	<br><strong>PROS<br></strong>
It can be used to better the quality of a movie or a TV show making it possible to recreate realistic effects in a short amount of time.
It can be used to recreate realistic simulations for training purposes, it could be for a job or for an assignment to practice for an exam.<br>

	<br><strong>CONS<br></strong>
Misinformation can be easily spread with the use of these deepfake tools.
Impersonating is another big problem often seen when it is talked about deepfake.
It can also be used to create explicit content without another person’s consent.
